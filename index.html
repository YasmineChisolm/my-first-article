                <p class="copy">The mother daughter dynamic is not one that anyone can understand but that mother, and that daughter. I don't care what anyone tells you, you'll never get it unless you're in it. My mother and I have always been close however as an adult, we had to work to get to this place.After observing several mother/daughter dynamics, I realized something happens around early adulthood when you realize your mother isn't this idea of perfection that you always thought she was, she's a person just like you. A person who makes mistakes, and who hasn't always got it right. At the same time she's realizing that even though you aren't as grown as you think you are, you're not a little girl anymore, you're becoming a young woman who doesn't need her as much as you used to. That transition can be difficult, especially if you aren't willing to hear each other.</p>

                <p class="copy">Many people admire the relationship that my mom and I have, but we didn't get here overnight. My mother definitely laid the foundation from the womb for this bond that we share, but that was just a foundation. Our relationship changes as we change. And in order for us to remain close, we had to actively work at it. Here are 5 ways that we worked to improve our relationship.</p>

                <b>1. Embrace where you are now</b>
                <p class="copy">I think what many people get wrong when it comes to repairing the relationship is the desire for things to go back to how they used to be. My childhood with my mother was beautiful, but that's over. I'm not a child. And as much as I love looking back at all of our old photos, we aren't those people anymore. Establishing love and respect for who we are today was essential to healing, because it required us to take a good look at one another and see each other as people for the first time.</p>

                <b>2. Hold yourself accountable</b>
                <p class="copy">When I think about certain instances where my mother and I weren't as close, I had to be honest with myself and ask what did I do to contribute to whatever we were dealing with at that particular time. Accountability allowed for me to admit to myself that yes my mother and I were not in the best place, but neither was I in my own life completely separate from her. And our relationship didn't get better until I began to work on myself.  You can't change anyone or anything until you look at you first, and that was a lesson that I had to learn the hard way at the expense of our relationship being strained for quite some time.</p>

                <b>3. Apologize and forgive</b>
                <p class="copy">Your mother will never be perfect, but guess what? Neither will you. My mother and I both have made mistakes and hurt each other knowingly, and unknowingly. That truth is one that isn't nice to hear but its necessary to acknowledge. Once we were able to sit down get honest with each other about what we were holding inside, it made it easier to move forward. Furthermore once my mother apologized to me, I let down some of the walls that I had up (in response to feeling like she didn't care that she hurt me). It's been my experience that culturally, black parents don't always know how to say I'm sorry. They make so many memes about it but there's nothing funny about the fact that as a community, we don't know how to dialogue with our children or with our families for that matter.</p>

                <b>4. Open communication</b>
                <p class="copy">For as long as I can remember my mom and I have had a very transparent relationship. We aren't exactly the Gilmore Girls, but for the most part no topic has been off-limits. My mother often says that there are certain things that we discuss, that she never would have with my grandmother, but I like to look at that as a good thing. There isn't a person on this earth who knows me like my mother, and that's the way it should be. I remember growing up having friends who never told their mothers anything, and I always wondered how they could even be close if they didn't know anything about each other? The only way a real bond can be developed is through honest conversation, and the older I get the more we share. And it's because of those talks I've not only grown to love her more but I now admire her for strength. Because her life hasn't always been easy, but she always made it look that way to me.</p>

                <b>5. Respecting each others boundaries</b>
                <p class="copy">Does this even need to be explained? Every relationship needs healthy boundaries. You're never going to agree with every choice your mother makes, and vice versa and that's okay. But it's the respect that you show one another in spite of that is what matters the most.</p>
